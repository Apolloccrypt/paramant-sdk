# Changelog

All notable changes to `paramant-sdk` (Python).

## [3.1.0] — 2026-05-23

Security release. Wire format unchanged (still v1, PQHB version `0x01`) — the relay
and existing tooling are unaffected. Only client behaviour changes.

### Fixed
- **Sender signatures are now verified (F1).** `receive()`/`_decrypt()` previously never
  called `sig_verify`, so a tampered signature or a swapped `sender_pub` was accepted
  silently. The signature is now verified before decryption and the blob is rejected
  (`SignatureError`) on failure.
- **Cross-SDK signing convention aligned (F3).** The signed message is now
  `CT_KEM || SENDER_PUB || NONCE || CIPHERTEXT || AAD` (matching sdk-js); 3.0.0 signed a
  different SHA-256 input, so py-signed blobs did not verify in sdk-js. The device
  fingerprint is now `SHA-256(kem_pub || sig_pub)` (binds the signing key) and is
  byte-identical to sdk-js. `/v2/pubkey` registers canonical `kem_pub`/`sig_pub` plus
  `kyber_pub`/`dsa_pub` aliases.
- **Receipts are verified client-side (F2).** `verify_receipt()` checks the relay's
  ML-DSA signature against a pinned `relay_identity_pub` instead of trusting the
  untrusted relay's `/v2/verify-receipt`.
- **Algorithm ids are no longer cosmetic (F4).** A `kem_id`/`sig_id` this build cannot
  perform now raises `UnsupportedAlgorithm` at construction instead of silently using
  ML-KEM-768/ML-DSA-65 while writing the requested id into the header.
- **Safe key zeroization (F5).** Secret material is held in `bytearray` and wiped in
  place; the 3.0.0 `ctypes.memset()` on immutable `bytes` (undefined behaviour) is gone.

### Added
- `receive(..., sender="device-id")` pins the sender's signing key (TOFU) to authenticate
  the origin; without it a warning is emitted.
- `GhostPipe(relay_identity_pub=...)` for client-side receipt verification.

### Migration
- Upgrade receivers and senders together. Existing keypairs are reused (no rotation).
- Existing local TOFU `known_keys` entries use the old fingerprint formula and will raise
  `FingerprintMismatchError` on next contact — re-`trust()` after out-of-band verification.

## [3.0.0] — 2026-04-24

### Breaking

- **Dropped `kyber-py` dependency.** Its own README explicitly warns against
  production use (not constant-time, timing-attack vulnerable). Replaced with
  [`pqcrypto`](https://pypi.org/project/pqcrypto/) (backbone-hq, Apache-2.0,
  thin CFFI over audited PQClean C code; pre-built wheels for Linux / macOS /
  Windows).
- **Removed the silent ECDH-P256 fallback.** v2.x quietly degraded to
  classical ECDH when `kyber-py` was absent while still advertising
  post-quantum protection. v3 raises `ImportError` at module load with a
  clear message instead.
- **Wire format v1** (`PQHB` magic, 10-byte header, KEM/SIG algorithm IDs,
  length-prefixed fields). See `docs/wire-format-v1.md`. v2 blobs
  (`0x02` legacy format) are not decryptable by v3.
- **Keypair file layout**: v2 `*.keypair.json` files without `ml_kem_pub` /
  `ml_dsa_pub` are renamed to `*.v2.bak` on first use and a fresh v3 keypair
  is generated.

### Added

- `paramant.wire_format` — byte-exact encoder / decoder matching
  `docs/wire-format-v1.md`. Test vectors reproduced:
    - signed:    `sha256=002b4f6aad4fa992804a3e94c46d514b4f842e9f5c283f7a31d7c76722d0476a`
    - anonymous: `sha256=46bce75b12e90ed312420fafcbead4108d55aa25273aee3ce4f2b4f61b3d19ef`
- `paramant.crypto` — pqcrypto wrappers for ML-KEM-768 and ML-DSA-65 plus
  AES-256-GCM with the spec's header-based AAD.
- `paramant.capabilities` — `/v2/capabilities` client + `negotiate()` that
  fetches and validates wire version and algorithm support before the first
  send. Unsupported combination raises `CapabilityMismatch`. No silent
  fallback.
- `GhostPipe(..., kem_id=, sig_id=, negotiate_on_init=)` constructor
  parameters for per-client algorithm override.
- `GhostPipe.capabilities()` — returns the relay's `RelayCapabilities`.
- CLI: `paramant-sdk capabilities --key ... --relay ...` prints the relay's
  advertised algorithms.

### Changed

- Default algorithms are now ML-KEM-768 (`0x0002`) + ML-DSA-65 (`0x0002`).
  Anonymous blobs use `sig_id=0x0000`.
- README rewritten to describe real v3 behaviour. v2 marketing claim of
  "ML-KEM-768" — which was only true when users happened to have `kyber-py`
  installed and never verified — removed.

### Required upgrades

1. `pip install 'paramant-sdk>=3'`
2. Environment must support `pqcrypto` wheels (Linux / macOS / Windows).
3. In-flight v2 blobs need to be re-encrypted under v3 (wire format
   incompatibility).
